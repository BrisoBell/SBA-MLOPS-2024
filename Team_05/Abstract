TITLE: FAKE NEWS DETECTION

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
  -> Fake news spreads quickly online, making it hard to tell whatâ€™s real or not. 
  -> This project uses machine learning to train models on real and fake news articles, helping manually check if a new article is true or false. 
  -> This helps fight misinformation and makes online news more trustworthy.
  
DATASET:
  -> True News Articles Dataset : 
        - Collection of verified, factual news articles.
  -> Fabricated News Articles Dataset : 
        - Collection of known fake news articles created with the intention of spreading misinformation.

ALGORITHM's USED: 
We applied four machine learning techniques to evaluate the model's performance.
  -> Logistic Regression : 
        - Transforms the output of the model to a probability between 0 and 1.
  -> Decision Tree Classifier : 
        - Predicts outcomes by splitting data into a tree structure based on input features.
  -> Gradient Boost Classifier : 
        - Helps prevent numerical instability or overfitting.
  -> Random Forest Classifier : 
        - Random forest classifiers are accurate and can handle large and complex datasets.
