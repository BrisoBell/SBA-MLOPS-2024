ABSTRACT:
In this project, presenting an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)using Machine Learning (ML). 
The primary objective of this system is to identify and classify potentially malicious network 
activities to enhance the security posture of a network. The scope of the project includes the 
development and implementation of an intelligent system capable of analyzing network traffic 
data in real-time, detecting anomalies, and alerting network administrators about potential 
security breaches.

Key features and functionalities of the system include:
• Real-time monitoring of network traffic data.
• ML-powered anomaly detection algorithms for identifying suspicious behaviour.
• Integration of data analytics techniques to process and interpret large volumes of 
network data.
• Integrated statistical analysis to detect deviations from normal network behaviour.
• Leverages historical data for training models and refining detection algorithms.
• Enables proactive threat detection and response through ML-driven analytics.
