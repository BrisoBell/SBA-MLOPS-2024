ABSTRACT:
In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity threats pose a significant risk to organizations' 
operations, data integrity, and reputation. With the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, it 
has become imperative for businesses and institutions to implement robust security measures 
to safeguard their networks and systems. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role 
in this regard by actively monitoring network traffic for signs of malicious activity and 
unauthorized access.
In my project, I aim to develop an advanced IDS leveraging cutting-edge Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and Data Analytics techniques. The primary objective of this system is to 
bolster network security by promptly detecting and responding to potential threats and 
intrusions. By analyzing network traffic data in real-time, the IDS can identify anomalous 
behaviour indicative of cyberattacks, such as unauthorized access attempts, malware infections, 
or data exfiltration.
Key features of my IDS include real-time monitoring of network traffic, AI-powered anomaly 
detection algorithms, integration of data analytics techniques for pattern recognition, and 
alerting mechanisms to notify network administrators about detected intrusions. Moreover, the 
system is designed to be scalable and adaptable, capable of evolving in response to emerging 
threats through continuous learning and model refinement.
With my project, we aim to provide organizations with a powerful tool to enhance their 
cybersecurity defenses, mitigate risks, and safeguard their critical assets against evolving cyber
threats
