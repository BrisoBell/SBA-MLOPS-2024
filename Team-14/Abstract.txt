Topic: Harmful object Detection
Team: J Jenolin Jeba (URK22CS5026)

We propose an approach to detect harmful objects using ML, specifically targeting items such as knives, guns, wine bottles, cigarettes and many others which are often associated with security threats or restricted use in certain environments. The proposed solution leverages unsupervised learning techniques to develop a robust and efficient detection model capable of identifying harmful objects from various image inputs.
