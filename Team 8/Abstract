1. Title
Diabetes Prediction System Using Machine Learning

2. Abstract
Diabetes is a prevalent health concern globally, making early detection critical.
This project implements a diabetes prediction system using a Random Forest classifier for predictions, coupled with a Django frontend.
The system enables users to input personal health data, generating a diabetes risk assessment through a trained machine learning model.
By providing user-friendly insights, it aids individuals in taking early preventive action.

3. Overview
Dataset: Features include age, pregnancies, BMI, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more, sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
Objective: Build a system that predicts diabetes risk with high accuracy using machine learning techniques.
Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature encoding.
Model Training: Focus on training a Random Forest model for prediction.
User Interface: A Django-based web interface for ease of use.
System Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to validate the model's performance.

4. What's Inside
Feature Analysis: Examination of important health attributes affecting diabetes risk.
Modeling Techniques: Use of Random Forest and comparison with other models such as SVM and Decision Trees.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.
