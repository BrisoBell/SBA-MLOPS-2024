This project develops a machine learning pipeline for classifying chest cancer using chest CT scan images. It leverages MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning, alongside DVC (Data 
Version Control) to manage datasets and ensure reproducibility. The pipeline includes essential components such as data ingestion, model training, and evaluation, with an emphasis on updating configuration 
files to refine processes and optimize workflow.
