1. Title:

Anemia Detection with Machine Learning 

2. Abstract:

• Anemia is a common condition caused by a lack of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin, 

resulting in symptoms like fatigue and weakness.

• Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and better health outcomes.

• This project aims to develop a machine learning model for anemia detection using a dataset 

from Kaggle provided by Biswa Ranjan Rao.

• MLOps practices are incorporated to ensure efficient deployment and management of the 

model.

3. Overview:

• The dataset includes 1,421 samples with features such as gender, hemoglobin level, MCH, 

MCHC, MCV, and a binary outcome (anemic or not).

• Focus is on building a simple, yet effective predictive model.

• Key aspects include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and applying MLOps for 

deployment.

4. What's Inside:

• Data Analysis: Exploration of data to understand distributions and patterns.

• Feature Selection: Identifying the most important features that influence anemia.

• Class Imbalance Handling: Techniques like oversampling and undersampling to balance the 

data.

• Model Training: Algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest 

Neighbors, SVM, and Naive Bayes.

• Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC.

• MLOps Practices: Implementing MLOps for model deployment, monitoring, and scalability.

5. Programming Language Used:

• Python: Primary language for model building and deployment.

o Utilizes libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

6. Requirements:

➢ Software:

• Python 3.x

• Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

➢ Libraries:

• Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.

• Pandas for data manipulation.

• Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

➢ MLOps Tools:

Tools like Docker, Git, and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions).

7. Database Used:

➢ Dataset:

 Consists of attributes such as gender, hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, MCV, and anemia status.

8. Algorithms Used and Other Usages:

Algorithms:

• Decision Tree

• Random Forest

• Logistic Regression

• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

• Support Vector Machine (SVM)

• Gaussian Naive Bayes

Other Usages:

model performance.

• Model Deployment: Using MLOps tools for deploying and managing the 

model in production environments.
